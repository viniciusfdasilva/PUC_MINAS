  abstract                   = {{The primary and most important aim of adults is to provide children with
   love, safety and acceptance. Children ought to be equipped with skills
   and abilities that will allow them to be self-reliant in the future and
   to independently cater for their needs and desires. Furthermore,
   children need to learn to trust the external world and acquire the rules
   of social life. Games and play, which accompany everyone from the first
   days of their lives, are very helpful in acquiring these skills. Games,
   undertaken by children every day, have their ``implicit programme{''}:
   on the one hand, they give one great pleasure, whereas on the other,
   they teach and develop.
   Playing is the basic form of activity of preschool children. Moreover,
   it is a natural and primary form of learning in the life of a child. It
   satisfies one's need to be active, gives one a rich diversity of
   experiences, joy, and satisfaction. When playing games, children in
   preschool enter into relations with their peers, feel responsible for
   their group, learn how to cooperate and follow rules and regulations.
   Children realize how important it is to respect other people's and own
   property, or how significant it is to respect one's friend. Through
   playing children develop and shape their emotional spheres, thus
   learning to control one's emotions and how to remain unaffected by
   stress and failures.
   Play supports the process of educating and teaching preschool children.
   Children can succeed and strive to attain their dream results when
   accomplishing tasks through an abundance of games. Implementing games
   into teaching minimizes child's efforts related to responsibilities.
   Children derive pleasure from playing. This feeling is one of the
   underlying criteria of distinguishing the described type of human
   activity from others, i.e. learning or working.
   Moreover, games play a particular role in stimulating comprehensive
   development of children. The article presents research and analysis
   regarding the influence of play on social and moral development of
   preschool children.}},

  abstract                   = {{Introduction: The non-stress test (NST) is one of the most commonly used
   tests to assess foetal well-being because of its high sensitivity, fast
   implementation, and ambulatory use. This study was conducted to
   determine the effect of music played to pregnant women during the
   non-stress test on the test result.
   Methods: A non-randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted in the
   NST polyclinic from March 3, to June 25, 2013. The population of the
   study included women who had applied to the NST polyclinic, had
   experienced a minimum of one live birth, had previously undergone the
   NST, and whose gestational week was >= 33. The sample comprised 96
   pregnant women who met the study criteria. Pregnant women visiting the
   NST polyclinic on Mondays were included in the experimental group, while
   those visiting on Wednesdays were included in the control group. A
   Participant Introductory Form and NST Findings Registry Form were used
   for data collection. The data were evaluated using descriptive
   statistics, t-test for independent groups, chi-square test, and Fisher's
   exact test.
   Results: The study revealed that the experimental group felt
   happier/more comfortable than the control group (p < .05). In addition,
   averages of foetal movement numbers, acceleration numbers, and reactive
   NST results in the experimental group were higher than the control group
   (p < .05). The experimental group had a higher reactive NST result than
   the control group (p < .05). The results of this study did not suggest a
   significant difference in the average heart rate of the experimental and
   control groups (p > .05).
   Conclusion: Our study findings demonstrate that music played to pregnant
   women during NST increases foetal movement and acceleration numbers and
   leads them to experience more positive feelings during the test.}},

  abstract                   = {{Schizophrenia is a syndrome that is typically accompanied by delusions
   and hallucinations that might be associated with insular pathology.
   Music intervention, as a complementary therapy, is commonly used to
   improve psychiatric symptoms in the maintenance stage of schizophrenia.
   In this study, we employed a longitudinal design to assess the effects
   of listening to Mozart music on the insular functional connectivity (FC)
   in patients with schizophrenia. Thirty-six schizophrenia patients were
   randomly divided into two equal groups as follows: the music
   intervention (MTSZ) group, which received a 1-monthmusic intervention
   series combined with antipsychotic drugs, and the no-music intervention
   (UMTSZ) group, which was treated solely with antipsychotic drugs.
   Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans were
   performed at the following three timepoints: baseline, 1 month after
   baseline and 6 months after baseline. Nineteen healthy participants were
   recruited as controls. An FC analysis seeded in the insular subregions
   and machine learning techniques were used to examine
   intervention-related changes. After 1 month of listening to Mozart
   music, the MTSZ showed increased FC in the dorsal anterior insula (dAI)
   and posterior insular (PI) networks, including the dAI-ACC,
   PI-pre/postcentral cortices, and PI-ACC connectivity. However, these
   enhanced FCs had vanished in follow-up visits after 6 months.
   Additionally, a support vector regression on the FC of the dAI-ACC at
   baseline yielded a significant prediction of relative symptom remission
   in response to music intervention. Furthermore, the validation analyses
   revealed that 1 month of music intervention could facilitate improvement
   of the insular FC in schizophrenia. Together, these findings revealed
   that the insular cortex could potentially be an important region in
   music intervention for patients with schizophrenia, thus improving the
   patients' psychiatric symptoms through normalizing the salience and
   sensorimotor networks.}},

   We propose that labelling one's feeling as being moved or touched is a
   component of a social-relational emotion that we term kama muta (its
   Sanskrit label). We hypothesise that it is caused by appraising an
   intensification of communal sharing relations. Here, we test this by
   investigating people's moment-to-moment reports of feeling moved and
   touched while watching six short videos. We compare these to six other
   sets of participants' moment-to-moment responses watching the same
   videos: respectively, judgements of closeness (indexing communal
   sharing), reports of weeping, goosebumps, warmth in the centre of the
   chest, happiness, and sadness. Our eighth time series is expert ratings
   of communal sharing. Time series analyses show strong and consistent
   cross-correlations of feeling moved and touched and closeness with each
   other and with each of the three physiological variables and
   expert-rated communal sharing - but distinctiveness from happiness and
   sadness. These results support our model.}},

   the extent to which other domains of aesthetic experience can similarly

   and behavioral responses, we show that recited poetry can act as a
   powerful stimulus for eliciting peak emotional responses, including
   chills and objectively measurable goosebumps that engage the primary
   reward circuitry. Importantly, while these responses to poetry are
   largely analogous to those found for music, their neural underpinnings
   show important differences, specifically with regard to the crucial role
   of the nucleus accumbens. We also go beyond replicating previous
   music-related studies by showing that peak aesthetic pleasure can
   co-occur with physiological markers of negative affect. Finally, the

  abstract                   = {{Anger control indicates the ability to manage the experience and
   expression of anger in a way that minimizes the negative impact to
   oneself and others. A lack of anger control characterizes in particular
   children with reactive-aggressive behavior and strongly impairs
   children's psychological well-being and social relationships. Aggressive
   behavior is often considered to be moderated by or the result of angry
   feelings. Treatment programs for children with aggressive behavior,
   however, focus on the development of social competence as an alternative
   behavior to aggression. This overview reports insights into the
   techniques of anger control using three German behavioral treatment
   approaches for children with aggressive behavior. The treatment programs
   focus on children between 6 and 12 years of age and are mainly carried
   out in group settings: (a) training with aggressive children, (b)
   Baghira training for children with oppositional and aggressive behavior,
   and (c) behavioral therapeutic intensive training for reduction of
   aggression. These treatment programs focus on the development of social
   competence in children with conduct disorders. All three treatment
   programs included self-verbalization and positive self-instructions as
   methods for anger control. Self-verbalizations and self-instructions are
   methods that children can use to guide angry behavior and angry feelings
   by directing their thoughts. Children learn how to use self-instructions
   in role play exercises of anger-triggering situations. The development
   of adaptive anger control strategies is a feature of all programs:
   Children are trained to develop several socially acceptable anger
   control strategies in order to replace aggressive behavior.
   Additionally, in all programs, concomitant parent training is conducted.
   In order to improve children's anger control, parents learn how to adapt
   the ``time-out{''} technique for their children. The differentiated
   efficacy of anger control techniques cannot be isolated since
   interventions for anger control are implemented in comprehensive
   treatment programs. Nevertheless, results of evaluation studies of the
   three treatment programs indicate a reduction in particular of
   aggressive-oppositional behavior through promoting social competence.
   Future dissemination studies should measure the isolated effect of anger
   control. Anger control skills that increase the time span between anger
   and aggression (e.g., self-instructions) are crucial to prevent
   aggressive behavior. Additionally, the development of anger control
   strategies is essential for children to learn different alternatives to
   cope with anger. Moreover, the development of anger awareness is
   necessary in treatment programs of aggressive behavior in children.}},

  abstract                   = {{Studies on emotion perception often require stimuli that convey
   different emotions. These stimuli can serve as a tool to understand how
   agents react to different circumstances. Although different stimuli have
   been commonly used to change the emotions of an agent, it is not clear
   how to measure the emotional state of an agent.
   This paper suggests a new method for measuring the emotional state among
   interacting agents in a given environment. We present the modeling of an
   adaptive emotional framework that takes into account agent emotion,
   interaction and learning process. For solving the problem, we employ a
   non-cooperative game theory approach for representing the interaction
   between agents and a Reinforcement Learning (RL) process for introducing
   the stimuli to the environment. We restrict our problem to a class of
   finite and homogeneous Markov games. The emotional problem is ergodic:
   each emotion can be represented by a state in a Markov chain which has a
   probability to be reached. Each emotional strategy of the Markov model
   is represented as a probability distribution. Then, for measuring the
   emotional state among agents, we employ the Kullback-Leibler distance
   between the resulting emotional strategies of the interacting agents. It
   is a distribution-wise asymmetric measure, then the feelings of one
   player for another are relative (different). We propose an algorithm for
   the RL process and for solving the game is proposed a two-step approach.
   We present an application example related to the selection process of a
   candidate for a specific position using assessment centers to show the
   effectiveness of the proposed method by a) measuring the emotional
   distance among the interacting agents and b) measuring the ``emotional
   closeness degree{''} of the interacting agents to an ideal proposed
   candidate agent. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   skills in recognizing emotional expressions and their problem behaviors.
   Few studies have examined these associations over time, however,
   precluding our understanding of the direction of effects. Emotion
   recognition difficulties may contribute to the development of problem
   behaviors; additionally, problem behaviors may constrain the development
   of emotion recognition skill. The present study tested the bidirectional
   linkages between children's emotion recognition and teacher-reported
   problem behaviors in 1st and 3rd grade. Specifically, emotion
   recognition, hyperactivity, internalizing behaviors, and externalizing
   behaviors were assessed in 117 children in 1st grade and in 3rd grade.
   Results from fully cross-lagged path models revealed divergent
   developmental patterns: Controlling for concurrent levels of problem
   behaviors and first-grade receptive language skills, lower emotion
   recognition in 1st grade significantly predicted greater internalizing
   behaviors, but not hyperactivity or externalizing behaviors, in 3rd
   grade. Moreover, greater hyperactivity in 1st grade marginally predicted
   lower emotion recognition in 3rd grade, but internalizing and
   externalizing behaviors were not predictive of emotion recognition over
   time. Together, these findings extend previous research to identify
   specific developmental pathways, whereby emotion recognition
   difficulties contribute to the development of internalizing behaviors,
   and early hyperactivity may contribute to the development of emotion
   recognition difficulties, thus highlighting the importance of examining
   these processes and their mutual development over time.}},

   attitude change leads to a higher level of visitation intention.
   Therefore, this study provides empirical evidence to confirm the
   effectiveness of VR in shaping consumers' attitude and behavior. (C)

   facial emotional expressions, little evidence has been gathered
   concerning their explicit knowledge of the components included in such

   components involved in the expressions of happiness, sadness, anger, and
   surprise. Four- and 5-year-old Japanese children were presented with the
   blank face of a young character, and asked to select facial components
   in order to depict the emotions he felt. Children's overall performance
   in the task increased as a function of age, and was above chance level
   for each emotion in both age groups. Children were likely to select the
   Cheek raiser and Lip corner puller to depict happiness, the Inner brow
   raiser, Brow lowerer, and Lid droop to depict sadness, the Brow lowerer
   and Upper lid raiser to depict anger, and the Upper lid raiser and Jaw
   drop to depict surprise. Furthermore, older children demonstrated a
   better knowledge of the involvement of the Upper lid raiser in surprise
   expressions.}},

  abstract                   = {{At the beginning of the twenty-first century, there was a growing sense
   that historians had neglected the emotions and failed to think seriously
   about them. Since then, there has been explosive interest in the history
   of emotions. What precipitated this development? What has this focus on
   emotion added to our historical understanding, and what does a
   historical perspective contribute to research on emotion? Two recent
   books help us think about these questions. In The History of Emotions,
   Jan Plamper offers the first book-length introduction to this field
   available in English; in Emotional Lexicons, Ute Frevert and a group of
   fellow historians trace continuities and change in the vocabulary of
   feeling from the beginning of the eighteenth century to the end of the
   millennium. At stake, in both books, is the idea that emotions are
   historically contingent-that history has the ability to shape and
   transform even the most basic features of human experience. This review
   essay engages with the central arguments of these books, and offers a
   somewhat different interpretation of the history of emotions. What is
   called for, the essay suggests, is not first and foremost a separate
   history of emotions nor the adding of emotion to existing histories, but
   new histories that systematically incorporate emotions into their
   analyses. Historians should seek to demonstrate how emotions are an
   integral part of history and historiography in a more general sense.
   Systematic attention to emotions not only adds nuance to a historical
   narrative, the essay concludes, but also fundamentally affects our ideas
   about how history actually happens.}},
