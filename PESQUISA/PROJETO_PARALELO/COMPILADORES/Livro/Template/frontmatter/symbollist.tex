\symbolentry{$\alpha$}{To solve the generator maintenance scheduling, in the  past, several mathematical techniques have  been applied.}
\symbolentry{$\sigma^2$}{These include integer programming, integer linear programming, dynamic programming, branch and bound etc.}
\symbolentry{$\sum$}{Several heuristic search algorithms have also been developed. In recent years expert systems,}
\symbolentry{$abc$}{fuzzy approaches, simulated annealing and genetic algorithms have also been tested.}
\symbolentry{$\theta\sqrt{abc}$}{This paper presents a survey of the literature}
\symbolentry{$\zeta$}{ over the past fifteen years in the generator}
\symbolentry{$\partial$}{maintenance scheduling. The objective is to}
\symbolentry{sdf}{present a clear picture of the available recent literature}
\symbolentry{ewq}{of the problem, the constraints and the other aspects of}
\symbolentry{bvcn}{the generator maintenance schedule.}
